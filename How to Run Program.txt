How to Run the Program.

I have made in such a way that no user input from keyboard is required.
Loading of the 30 Pounds happens in the program, and the starts calculating the balances.

We can either import the project into an ide, eg eclipse. and the run App.java class.

A better way - no ide required, is to run the jar file. with is found in the target folder.
use the following command to run the jar file
		
	java -jar oystercard-problem-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Output Result
Card has been loaded with 30.0 Pounds
Balance after Holborn to Earl’s Court 27.5 Pounds
Balance after 328 bus from Earl’s Court to Chelsea 25.7 Pounds
Balance after Earl’s court to Hammersmith 23.7 Pounds
